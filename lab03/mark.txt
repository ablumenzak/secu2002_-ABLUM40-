notes:
-in swap.py, could put print statement at the end (since it's repeated) and 
 just need one if statement, not if-else (see solution)
-in hangman.py, get a NameError when I run it because r isn't defined - this
 is because - is mixed up with _, so r is defined within an if statement that
 doesn't get run. count also seems to be mixed up with counter, and because
 you're using index the phrase replaces only one character at a time. the
 length of the shown phrase is also specific to this secret phrase.
-in hangman.py, more extensive commenting would help explain what you're 
 trying to do, which in turn would help me give partial credit
